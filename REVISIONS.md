Given more time and thought I could probably simplify the various logic sections used in the solution.

Some of the if/then statements could probably cleaner. I also could have used better naming conventions. I would also test things out more with various use-cases.

Using typescript could have come in handy since I ran into compiler errors that many times would be user input error. Static type checking may have sped things up for me.
